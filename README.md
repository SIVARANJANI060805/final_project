1.Test Coverage Dashboard:
This project automates the process of running unit tests and measuring code coverage using pytest and coverage.py. The generated coverage data is parsed and visualized through charts and tables to identify poorly tested files. An interactive Streamlit dashboard presents these insights, helping developers improve test quality and maintain reliable software.
2.Python chat app (LAN):
This project implements a multi-client LAN chat system using Python sockets and threading.The server handles concurrent clients, message broadcasting, command processing, and logging.Threading ensures real-time communication while socket timeouts enable graceful shutdown.
